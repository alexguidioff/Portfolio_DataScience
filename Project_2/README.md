# Analysis of Police Shootings in the US

**Objective:**  
Analyze data on police shootings in the United States to identify potential racial biases.

**Dataset:**  
- `fatal-police-shootings-data.csv` (Washington Post / Kaggle)  
- `PopulationByCity.csv` (US city population data)  
- `ShareRaceByCity.csv` (racial population share)

**Methodology:**  
1. Data cleaning and aggregation  
2. Analyze killings by race and by state  
3. Calculate killing rates adjusted for population share  
4. Visualize findings using barplots, stripplots, and relplots  

**Key Results:**  
- Evidence of overrepresentation of certain ethnic groups in police killings  
- Final plots show racial bias across states and cities

**Required Libraries:**  
```python
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, cowsay
