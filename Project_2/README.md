# Gun Violence Analysis in the United States

## Context
Gun violence is a critical social issue in the United States. By analyzing data from reported incidents, we can better understand patterns and identify key risk factors.

## Objective
The project analyzes gun violence data to explore trends, high-risk areas, and incident characteristics. The goals include:

- Exploring incident distribution over time and geography
- Identifying states and cities with the highest rates
- Understanding correlations between incident characteristics

## Data Sources
- [Gun Violence Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jameslko/gun-violence-data)
  - Dataset includes incidents, locations, dates, and casualty numbers from 2013 onward.

## Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset using Pandas.
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, date formatting, categorical encoding).
3. Aggregate data by state, city, and year.
4. Visualize trends using bar plots, heatmaps, and time series charts.
5. Analyze correlations between incident types, number of victims, and location factors.
6. Draw insights on patterns and trends over time.
