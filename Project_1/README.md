# Wine Quality Analysis

## Context
Understanding wine quality is a challenge for producers and consumers alike. By analyzing chemical properties of wines, we can identify which factors influence quality and provide actionable insights for better production.

## Objective
This project analyzes red and white wine datasets to explore the relationship between chemical attributes and wine quality. The goal is to:

- Explore data distributions and correlations
- Preprocess data for modeling
- Train predictive models to classify wine quality

## Data Sources
- [Wine Quality Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
  - Includes physicochemical properties (acidity, sugar content, pH, etc.) and quality scores for red and white wines.

## Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset using Pandas.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and outliers.
3. Visualize relationships between chemical features and wine quality using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Encode categorical features and scale numerical features.
5. Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict wine quality.
6. Visualize model performance and feature importance.
