# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a selection of six data science projects completed as part of my technical exercises. The goal of these projects is to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization using Python.

## Repository Structure

Each project is stored in its own folder with the following structure:

Project1_Name/
├─ notebook.ipynb
├─ README.md
Project2_Name/
├─ notebook.ipynb
├─ README.md
…

- Each folder contains a **Jupyter Notebook** with the full code and analysis.  
- The **README.md** inside each project folder provides a summary and instructions in English.  
- **Note:** The notebooks themselves contain explanations and comments in **Italian**, describing the steps, data manipulations, and results.

## Projects Overview

1. **Wine Classification with KNN** – Build a predictive model to classify wines based on chemical properties.  
2. **Analysis of Police Shootings in the US** – Analyze police shooting data to detect potential racial biases.  
3. **Project 3** – [Short description here]  
4. **Project 4** – [Short description here]  
5. **Project 5** – [Short description here]  
6. **Project 6** – [Short description here]  

*(Descriptions for Projects 3-6 can be updated once notebooks are added.)*
