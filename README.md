# Data Science Portfolio üöÄ

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository contains multiple projects developed during my studies and personal work. Each project is organized in its own folder, and each folder contains a `README.md` in Italian that describes the project in detail, including data analysis, preprocessing steps, and code explanations.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

Each project is stored in its own folder with the following structure:

- **Project_1/**
  - `Project 1 ‚Äì Wine Classification with KNN.ipynb`
  - `README.md`

- **Project_2/**
  - `PopulationByCity.csv`
  - `Project 2 - Analysis of Police Shootings in the US.ipynb`
  - `README.md`
  - `ShareRaceByCity.csv`
  - `fatal-police-shootings-data.csv`

- **Project_3/**
  - `FAO.csv`
  - `Food_Production.csv`
